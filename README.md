Questions from coding assessment.

1. Seating Arrangements:

Based on above arrangement of occupied desks, there are a total of 6 ways to seat 2 new students next to each other. The combinations are: [1, 31, [3,4], [3, 51, 18, 101, 19, 101, 110, 12). So for this input your program should return 6. K will range from 2 to 24 and will always be an even number. After K, the number of occupied desks in the array can range from 0 to K.
Once your function is working, take the final output string and concatenate it with your ChallengeToken, and then replace every fourth character with an underscore.
Your ChallengeToken: 46arkmwb91. 
Examples
Input: [6,4]
Output: 4
Final Output: 446_rkm_b91
Input: [8, 1, 81
Output: 6
Final Output: 646_rkm_b91
